Go through the attached ppt and query file 
Over View - •	Data loaded to MS SQL Server undergo certain query operations to calculate KPI’s, MTD, MoM, comparing percentage of Good & Bad Loans
•	Identifying Overview of loan trend wrt Month, State, Term 
•	Creating Dashboard in PowerBI by adding columns, DAX measures, making it more interactive with aid of slicers, formatting dashboard, comparing the results.


This involves writing SQL queries to extract, transform, and analyze data, ensuring its accuracy and integrity throughout the process.

One of the primary tasks I undertake is to identify and analyze loan trends based on different parameters such as Month, State, and Term. This involves aggregating data, applying statistical methods, and visualizing trends using tools like PowerBI. By dissecting the data in this manner, I gain insights into patterns and behaviors that help in making informed decisions and optimizing business strategies.

To communicate these insights effectively, I leverage PowerBI to create interactive dashboards. These dashboards are designed to be user-friendly, allowing stakeholders to explore the data dynamically. I incorporate various elements such as columns, DAX measures, slicers, and formatting techniques to enhance the dashboard's interactivity and usability. This not only facilitates better understanding of the data but also enables users to make data-driven decisions efficiently.

Moreover, I regularly compare the results obtained from different queries and analyses to identify any discrepancies or anomalies. This involves meticulously examining the data, verifying calculations, and ensuring that the insights derived are consistent and reliable. By conducting these comparisons, I ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data being presented, which is crucial for making informed business decisions.

In addition to my technical skills, I also possess strong analytical and problem-solving abilities. I approach each task with a systematic and logical mindset, breaking down complex problems into manageable components. This allows me to identify the root cause of issues and implement effective solutions efficiently. My attention to detail and commitment to delivering high-quality work ensure that the insights I provide are accurate, reliable, and actionable.

In conclusion, my work with MS SQL Server, data analysis, and PowerBI revolves around extracting insights from data to support decision-making processes. By leveraging these tools and techniques, I am able to derive meaningful insights, identify trends, and communicate findings effectively. My analytical skills, attention to detail, and commitment to excellence enable me to deliver high-quality work consistently, contributing to the success of the projects I undertake.
